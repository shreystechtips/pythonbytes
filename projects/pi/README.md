## From Py to Pi


[Here is a link to this page.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/pi#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


pi is approximately 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816...


You can find many expressions for pi that can be calculated using Python code. For example:

The goal for this project is to see how many ways you can calculate pi; and then how accurate are they??? For example 
does the above formula become more accurate as you add more and more fractions according to the same pattern? 


### Monte Carlo method


Throw darts at random at a square dart board with a circle drawn upon it. Track both the total number of darts
you throw (let us call that **T** for **Total**) and the number of darts that fall inside the circle. Let's call
that **C** for **Circle**. But let me be clear: The square is 1 x 1 and the circle has a radius of one-half. It 
is centered on the square. 


Now calculate **4 x C / T**. What do you get? What happens if you change your Python program to throw more darts?
